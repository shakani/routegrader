# RouteGrader

Rock climbing is an increasingly popular sport that helps you stay in shape and make new friends. It’s an exciting activity for seasoned climbers, but like any sport it can be difficult for new climbers to get started. 

That’s where RouteGrader can help!

Climbing gyms have standardized interactive training walls called Moonboards. The online Moonboard community has collected and graded thousands of routes that can be configured at your local gym. Using RouteGrader, you can design your own custom route and have it graded on the spot! 

RouteGrader is a great tool to help new climbers get started with their Moonboard training, but it’s also useful for veteran climbers too. 

Do you have a favorite route that you’d like to make more difficult? Load it and tweak it in RouteGrader to see how much harder it is! If you’re stuck on a challenging route and want to make it easier, change a hold to give yourself a stepping stone on your way to the top. 

RouteGrader leverages the muscle of the Moonboard community and machine learning. Here’s how it works:

We first scrape the Moonboard community website for pre-graded routes. Each route contain information about where holds are located on the route and the difficulty of the route. This pre-graded route data is then stored in a database. 

Next, we use this data to train a custom machine learning model which can predict the difficulty of a previously unobserved route. 

Whether you’re new to the community or just looking to tune your climbing training, RouteGrader is the tool for you.
